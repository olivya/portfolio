	For this project, I chose to do a movie poster for "Memoirs of a Geisha" in the style of Art Nouveau (specifically Alphonse Mucha). This art style is characterized by flowing lines, organic elements, relatively muted colours, ornate design work, and frequently women as focal points.
	<br/><br/>
	I began by sketching the drawing on paper, then scanned it onto the computer and completed the rest digitally. The challenge of working in a different style was interesting as it quickly became clear which aspects of the other artist's work overlap with mine and which don't. Due to this, I was able to improve the ability to put my natural inclinations aside to emulate a different style.
	<br/><br/>
	I believe being open to new approaches and flexible in your own is necessary to learn and grow in any creative field, and seeking inspiration from others' work is an excellent way to exercise this.
