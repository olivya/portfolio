	This was an individual project for a Mobile Application Design & Development course. The idea was to design and develop a novel user experience for a relatively basic app (in this case, a to-do list app). My vision was to create a more visual experience than the typical text-based list, where the user can drag and interact with their tasks in the form of bubbles (hence, "Bubbalist").
	<br/><br/>
	This project involved the use of many JavaScript libraries. Most notably, I used the AngularJS framework to create a single-page application (SPA). The use of these various resources improved my web design abilities as I learned how to effectively take advantage of external resources to enhance the coding process and extend my app's capabilities.
	<br/><br/>
	The result was a more efficient app that leveraged already-made libraries to improve the user experience. This also resulted in swifter development and allowed for more time to be spent on other design components unique to the app itself. For the visual design, I opted for a lighthearted, playful feel (bright colours, bubble font, etc.) to go along with the novel user experience. I also kept the UI relatively simple, with clear icons and intuitive, easy-to-remember gestures.
