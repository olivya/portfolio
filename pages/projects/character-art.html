	I’ve always loved drawing, and this interest only became stronger once I learned how to use Photoshop and discovered the world of digital art. One of my favourite hobbies is designing original characters as well as drawing characters I love from other creators in my own style. In short, I just love to be creative and use my imagination!
	<br/><br/>
	I also love to keep sketchbooks, and not all of my drawings make it to the stage of being completed digitally.
	<br/><br/>
	I find inspiration in many places, but my favourite subject matter is usually nature-related: principally people and animals. There are also several artists I idolize; their work constantly motivates me to improve and try new techniques.
