	This personal game project was a collaboration with other students who were similarly looking to gain experience in their respective fields. Being the sole concept artist it was my job to take the level descriptions provided to me by the developers and create a piece that will illustrate the "look & feel" of these game environments for the animators, 3D modelers, texture artists, and so on to work from. I had the creative liberty to add any details I felt would make the designs feel more authentic, and was encouraged to do so.
	<br/><br/>
	The pieces consisted of manmade, industrial objects & perspective drawings. Before this project, these subjects were entirely out of my comfort zone - but after a lot of practice (and trial & error), I was very pleased with how my skills progressed. It became clear from the start how much time and detail goes into making a room look “real” and give off the vibe I pictured in my head.
	<br/><br/>
	With the control room (the left-most image), for example, I had to detail everything from the lighting and shadows to the texture on the walls to achieve the creepy and dirty, yet high-tech, look I was aiming for. My work recieved positive feedback and I loved having the freedom to be creative in bringing the descriptions handed to me to life!
