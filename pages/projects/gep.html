<div class="proj-blurb default smaller">
	I was the sole creator of visual marketing materials during my co-op term. It was emphasized to me that brand emphasis & development were priority so as to build up recognition in the community. As a result, persistent and clear use of the brand's colours, fonts, and logo was key.
	<br/><br/>
	In order to ensure the materials were aesthetically pleasing and eye-catching, I took it upon myself to mould these assets in creative ways. Examples include making background patterns, utilizing unique compositions, and using decorative typographic elements.
	<br/><br/>
	Through consistent use of the brand's assets, along with creative touches, I was able to create distinct materials that still fit together when viewed as a whole. My efforts were met with positive feedback from my supervisors, who encouraged my creative liberty and conveyed their appreciation for the artistic & unique ways I interpreted and expressed the brand identity.
