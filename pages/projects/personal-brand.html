<div class="proj-blurb default smaller">
	Upon graduating from university, I began developing my personal brand. I wanted to come up with a design to attractively and professionally present who I am as an artist, designer, and hiring candidate.
	<br/><br/>
	It was important to me to find a visual identity that presents itself both as professional and artistic - I wanted it to appropriately be able to encompass the wide variety of work I am interested in, while remaining unified in one single location (i.e., my online portfolio). I see my portfolio as an extension of my resume; that is, it further details my skills and experiences to give a broader picture and demonstration of my abilities.
	<br/><br/>
	Naturally, the website itself is also an example of my work; as such, it was important for me to build it myself (utilizing some JavaScript libraries to streamline the process) and make it my own: a quintessential example of my design style and technical abilities, while serving the dual purpose of hosting and presenting my other projects in a way that also maximizes their own individual merits.
