	For this project, our 4-person group build a fully functional game in the span of a semester (4 months). It was necessary to ensure effective communications between group members to ensure tasks were completed in a timely manner (a task I took on as project manager), as well as ensure the project itself was appropriately scoped for the time period and tools we had available at our disposal.
	<br/><br/>
	Our group chose to create a 2D action-adventure platformer with 4 levels. We liked the idea of a narrative playing a key role in the game to add interest for players. Throughout the process, myself and my 2 co-programmers had to essentially learn C# and the Unity API from scratch in a short period of time. This was challenging, but once gaining familiarity I realized how much I really love the process of programming and seeing my efforts come to fruition as our game developed. Overall, my programming skills improved tremendously over the course of this project. <a href="https://github.com/olivya/wind-city" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view the scripts on Github.

	We also held 3 playtesting sessions, between which we would use our participants' experiences (i.e. what they liked and disliked, where they got stuck or confused, etc.) to improve the game for the next version. Therefore, we managed to experience the process of taking a game through the intial prototype, alpha, beta, and gold code stages (albeit somewhat expedited versions of each).
	<br/><br/>
	This project was a tremendous learning experience for me; the programming element in particular, of course, but I also had the valuable experience of acting as project manager and being in charge of our different roles and tasks all while maintaining a positive group dynamic in the midst of tight, sometimes stressful deadlines and often frustrating challenges we had to overcome as a team.
	<br/><br/>
	Wind City won first place in the final project showcase, as judged by industry professionals.
