I am an aspiring artist, designer, and Jill of all trades. I graduated in Spring of 2015 from Simon Fraser University with a Bachelor of Business Administration with Distinction, joint majoring in Interactive Arts and Technology & Business Administration. It's a bit of a mouthful, but essentially it boils down to technology + design + business.
<br/><br/>
What is Interactive Arts and Technology (IAT), you might ask? Well, it’s pretty much exactly what it sounds like - the study of the interaction between humans and technology! This includes everything from the design of graphics, user interfaces, websites, games, and much more... all of it having the focus of optimizing (and beautifying) the countless daily experiences that most of us have with devices like computers and smartphones.

<br/><br/>
Having studied both design and business is pretty nifty - it has given me a unique insight into two different (yet related) perspectives. Regardless, I will always consider myself an artist at heart. ♥
<br/><br/>
Art, design, technology, and the numerous combinations thereof are among my biggest passions. I’m constantly finding new things I want to learn and do, from designing and programming games to making my own fonts. I find inspiration everywhere!
<br/><br/>
What else? Well, I’m an animal and nature lover, bookworm, enthusiastic organizer, Wikipedia surfer, chronic list-maker, and supporter of the Oxford comma. I have a long-standing love for Pokémon and Harry Potter. I’m a bona fide cat mom to a monster kitty called Mucha (named after artist Alphonse Mucha, who was actually the inspiration for <a id="link" href="projects/geisha">this project!</a>).
